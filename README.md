Exercise 2.1
Use a GeneralPath to draw a rectangle with rounded corners.
Exercise 2.2
A simple two-dimensional solar system model with one sun and one planet
should be animated. The centre of the sun is located in the origin of the coordinate system. The spherical planet with a radius of 10 units rotates anticlockwise around the sun on a circular orbit with constant speed. The radius of the
planet’s orbit (the distance between the centres of the sun and the planet) is
200 units. In the beginning of the animation the centre of the planet is located
at the point (200, 0). During one rotation around the sun, the planet rotates
365 times anticlockwise around its own axes. Consider the point on the planet
that is closest to the sun in the beginning of the animation. Use geometric
transformations to describe where the point will be located after the planet
has finished one third of its orbit.
Exercise 2.3
Choose the constant c in the matrix
⎛
⎝
c 0 6
0 c 4
0 0 c
⎞
⎠
in such a way that the matrix represents a translation by the vector (3, 2)⊤ i
homogeneous coordinates.
Exercise 2.4
Use Java 2D for an animation illustrating the movement of the point in exercise
2.2.
Exercise 2.5
Use Java 2D to animate a beating heart that moves along a line in a window
on the computer screen.
Exercise 2.6
Apply the technique for transforming one letter into another as illustrated in
figure 2.22 for the letters D and C to other letters, for instance your initials
